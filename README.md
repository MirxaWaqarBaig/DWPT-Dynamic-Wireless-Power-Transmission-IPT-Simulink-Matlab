# MirxaWaqarBaig-DWPT---Dynamic-Wireless-Power-Transmission-IPT-Simulink-Matlab
This repository contains the simulink implementation file for DWPT. The DWPT is implemented through IPT technique. 


It is basically designed keeping in view the battery requirement of the electric vehicle. 
The aim is to check whether a smaller battery is efficient in DWPT case or a bigger battery.
